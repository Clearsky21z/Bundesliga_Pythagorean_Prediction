# Introduction

# Methodology
## Pythagorean Expectation for Soccer

We use a four-parameter variant of the Pythagorean expectation adapted to the 3-points-per-win system:

$$
\text{frac}_i=\frac{\text{GF}_i^{\,b}}{\text{GF}_i^{\,c}+\text{GA}_i^{\,d}},
\qquad
\widehat{\text{PTS}}_i = a \cdot \text{frac}_i \cdot \text{PLD}_i,
$$

where $i$ indexes a team–season observation; $a>0$ is a scale parameter mapping the win fraction to points; $b,c,d>0$ control the non-linearity and the relative influence of scoring vs. conceding.

## Estimation on Historical Seasons

Let $y_i=\text{PTS}_i$ and $\hat{y}_i(a,b,c,d)$ be the model prediction from the formula above. We estimate $(a,b,c,d)$ by minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) across all team–season observations in the **2010–11 to 2023–24** pool:

$$
(a^{\*}, b^{\*}, c^{\*}, d^{\*}) \;=\; \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{a,b,c,d}
\;\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left|\,y_i - \hat{y}_i(a,b,c,d)\,\right|.
$$

Optimization uses the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm (derivative-free) with multiple starting values (including Beggs’ EPL coefficients) to reduce sensitivity to local minima. The resulting $(a^{\*},b^{\*},c^{\*},d^{\*})$ are treated as **Bundesliga-specific coefficients** and reused for forecasting in new seasons.

## Out-of-Sample Validation (Historical)

We assess generalization via leave-one-season-out (LOSO) validation. For each season $s$ in the estimation pool, we refit $(a,b,c,d)$ on all other seasons and evaluate on $s$. Performance is summarized by the median MAE and Pearson correlation $r$ between actual and predicted EoS points across held-out seasons.
